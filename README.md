# BMEN-415

This is our term project for BMEN 415. Here we chose to analyze a breast cancer dataset for classification (wdbc.data), a COVID-19 diet-related dataset for regression (Protein_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv), and an Alzheimer dataset for the challenge problem: image-based classification of MRI images.
